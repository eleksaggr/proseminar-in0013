\section{Introduction}
Garbage collection and reference counting are both types of memory management techniques.
These techniques are all about the maximization of performance and effectiveness of memory usage in programs.
Today there are a few different approaches to memory management.
The first is manual memory management, where there are no mechanisms that help you when managing your heap memory.
The developer has to allocate the right amount of memory and free it after usage.
Further he must know himself whether memory was already freed or is still in use.
As you might have already guessed, this can cause a lot of trouble for the programmer, especially to those new to manual memory management or programming in general.
Bugs that occur often when using memory management are for example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use-after-free errors, where memory is used after having already been freed
    \item Double-free errors, where memory is freed twice, leading to unexpected behavior
    \item Memory leaks, where memory is continually wasted during execution
\end{itemize}

Many programming languages have found ways to deal with these problems, by giving the responsibility of memory management to a dedicated mechanism, called \textit{garbage collection}.
This mechanism detects whether memory can be freed without help from the programmer, and allows the programmer to forget about freeing memory by himself.
And as to why one would choose Rusts approach, is a tricky question.
Rust is a very complex and intricate language with a very steep learning curve.
And the complexity stems from there exactly.
The performance and memory safety with zero-cost abstractions it provides makes it an attractive contender for many tasks in todays market.
It is faster than most garbage collected languages in many scenarios \cite{Benchmark} and has a performance close to C in some regards.
The compiler is very strict and most errors that are runtime errors in other programming languages are compile-time errors in Rust.
This makes Rust suited for applications that absolutely cannot fail at runtime.

\section{Garbage Collection}
\subsection{General principle}
The general motivation behind garbage collection is taking away the risks of managing the memory on your own, and offering viable solutions to the bugs introduced in \ref{introduction}.
As the name already suggests, garbage collection tries to free memory of objects that are no longer used in the application.
When the algorithm detects an unused, but allocated memory space, it will free it. 
Garbage collection is often called slow, which is not entirely correct. Matthew Hertz and Emery D. Berger write the following: ``In particular, when garbage collection has five times as much memory as
required, its runtime performance matches or slightly exceeds that of explicit memory management.
However, garbage collectionâ€™s performance degrades substantially when it must use smaller heaps. With
three times as much memory, it runs 17\% slower on average, and with twice as much memory, it runs 70\%
slower.''\cite{HertzBerger05}.
\subsubsection{Mark \& Sweep}
\textit{Mark \& Sweep} does exactly that.
It is an algorithm, that starting from a root set, which is usually a combination of variables currently on the stack, active threads and the data segment, does a graph search to find objects that can still be reach via references. These objects and the root set can be seen in figure \ref{mark-sweep-setup}.
Afterwards it scans the entire heap memory and marks any objects that are unreachable, as seen in figure \ref{mark-sweep-mark}.
The unreachable objects are then removed in the ``sweep'' stage, as seen in figure \ref{mark-sweep-sweep}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Reference Counting}
\label{reference-counting}
\textit{Reference counting} is a simple garbage collection algorithm, that uses reference counts to deallocate objects that are no longer referenced, and thus free the underlying memory.
Here reference count refers to an internal counter, that tracks the amount of active references to a specific object.
Every time an active reference is destroyed the internal reference counter for that object is decremented.
Correspondingly when a new reference to an object is created, the reference counter is incremented, to reflect the number of active references.
When an objects reference count falls to zero, the object becomes inaccessible.
The memory used by such an inaccessible object can be then be freed safely.

Reference counting seems superior to any tracing algorithm, because of its simplicity, but there are a few caveats, that are not visible at first glance.
Firstly when handling a large amount of objects a deletion may cause a large amount of objects to be freed in a chain reaction.
This chain reaction can then use up valuable processing time, resulting in a largely unresponsive application for a user.
This pitfall can be circumvented with the following approach: Whenever an object should be ordinarily deleted, it is instead added to a list of objects that are to be freed.
The list can then be processed at another point in time, effectively making the whole technique incremental.

A more severe problem is posed by \textit{reference cycles}, where multiple references reference each other, leading to a non-tree-like structure.
These cycles can not be reclaimed, since each object depends on another being freed first.
These shortcomings render reference counting unsatisfactory in most contexts, but the following situations:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Reference loops are impossible.
        \item Modifications of references are infrequent.
        \item Memory constraints are very tight.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Ownership \& Lifetimes}
\label{ownership}
Memory safety is one of Rusts primary goals and it achieves it also due to the strict rules about ownership and lifetimes employed by the compiler.
Rust requires a variable to have \textit{exactly one} owner, where owner means variable binding.
This can be understood when looking at figure \ref{ownership-transfer} closely.
First we define a \mintinline{rust}{struct Owned} type.
We then instantiate a new object of this type and bind it to the binding with the name \mintinline{text}{x}.
Next we tell the binding \mintinline{text}{y} to take ownership of the object \mintinline{text}{x} currently owns.
If we then try to use \mintinline{text}{x} again, we will be greeted with a compiler error, since we just broke the ownership rules.
Once \mintinline{text}{y} took ownership the other binding was invalidated, and thus the rule of having exactly one owner was restored.
Note here that this example would be optimized away by the compiler, since \mintinline{rust}{Owned} is a Zero Sized Type\cite{Nomicon-ZST}.
When an owner goes out of scope, its corresponding value is cleaned up.

Further Rust enforces strict rules about references or borrowing rules, that can be summed up as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There may be \textit{one or more} \mintinline{rust}{&T} references to an object at any time.
    \item There may be \textit{exactly one} \mintinline{rust}{&mut T} reference to an object at any time.
\end{itemize}
These choices are \textit{mutually exclusive}.
By making it impossible to have \mintinline{rust}{&T} and \mintinline{rust}{&mut T} references at the same time Rust tries to avoid data races, where one thread reads data with its \mintinline{rust}{&T} reference, while the other writes using its \mintinline{rust}{&mut T} reference.
In figure \ref{borrowing} we create a variable binding called \mintinline{text}{x}.
Then we create a mutable reference to this same variable.
And then we'd like to print it's content to the screen.
But this code leads to a compiler error, namely ``error[E0502]: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable''.
The function underlying the \mintinline{rust}{println!} macro takes a immutable reference to its argument.
So implicitly one was created and the borrowing rules were broken, since we already had an active \mintinline{rust}{&mut u32} reference.

To avoid dangling references Rust uses lifetimes.
Every reference has a lifetime associated with it.
Usually the compiler infers these lifetimes and simply looks at how long the owner of the object lives.
Lifetimes in action can be seen in figure \ref{lifetime-dangling}.
The compiler sees that \mintinline{text}{x} does not live long enough, for the reference to \mintinline{text}{r} to be still valid and throws an error.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Owned {}

let x = Owned{};

// Y takes ownership of the Owned object.
let y = x;

// This won't work.
println!("{:?}", x);
\end{rustcode}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
let mut x: u32 = 42;

// Create a immutable reference.
let x_ref = &mut x;

// This leads to a compiler error!
println!("{}", x);
\end{rustcode}

    {
        let y = 32;
        x = &y;
    }
println!("{}", x);
\end{rustcode}

\end{figure}
\section{Using memory in Rust}
\subsection{Allocating data on the heap}
\label{box}
It is common practice to store long-lived data on the heap section of the memory, as the lifetime of the data is then decoupled of the lifetime of its local function.
Rust allows allocating data on the heap by using the \mintinline{rust}{Box<T>} struct.
A \mintinline{rust}{Box} may be created by calling the \mintinline{rust}{Box::new()} method, as can be seen in figure \ref{box-example}.
It may seem like there is some kind of magic underneath the \mintinline{rust}{Box} type, but that would be contrary to Rusts goals.
In fact a \mintinline{rust}{Box} is only a wrapper around a raw pointer (see \ref{raw-pointer}), that points to the heap, and the size of the object that is stored.
A simple implementation of this \mintinline{rust}{Box} type is shown in figure \ref{box-definition}.
When not fully accustomed to the Rust type system one may be puzzled by the \mintinline{rust}{where}-clause in the struct definition.
This clause simply says the type that is stored in the \mintinline{rust}{Box} must have a fixed size and may not be a Dynamically Sized Type\cite{BlogDST}, like for example a Trait.

Now there is still the question of how the memory used by a \mintinline{rust}{Box} is freed.
The \mintinline{rust}{Box} struct implements the \mintinline{rust}{Drop} trait.
The documentation for this trait describes it as follows: ``The \mintinline{rust}{Drop} trait is used to run some code when a value goes out of scope. This is sometimes called a destructor''\cite{RustDoc-Drop}.
The \mintinline{rust}{Box} type uses this trait to free the memory reserved on the heap, when it goes out of scope.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
fn main() {
    let i: u8 = 42;
    let b = Box::new(i);
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{A program that stores an \mintinline{rust}{u8} on the heap.}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
pub struct Box<T> where T: ?Sized {
    pointer: *mut T,
    size: usize,
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{A simplified example definition of the \mintinline{rust}{Box} type.}
\label{box-definition}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Reference Counting in Rust}
Usually when creating a variable binding in Rust, the value stored in the variable is owned by it (see \ref{ownership}).
You may run into situations, where the exact lifetime of a pointer is unknown, since it may be, for example, dependant on user input.
In such cases the compiler can not directly evaluate the lifetime of a variable and may restrict this behavior.
For these cases Rust offers a type called \mintinline{rust}{Rc<T>}\cite{RustDoc-Rc}.
The type basically consists of a pointer to a region in the heap memory and a counter that counts the amount of active references to the object, according to the rules in section \ref{reference-counting}.
These reference counters can be created as seen in figure \ref{rc-new}.
To increment the reference counter and create a new reference to an existing \mintinline{rust}{Rc} we can use \mintinline{rust}{Rc::clone()} as seen in figure \ref{rc-clone}.
Obviously all instances cloned from an \mintinline{rust}{Rc} point to the same object, and thus any reference can modify it.
The object that is stored in the \mintinline{rust}{Rc} will stay alive, as long as there is still a living reference pointing to it.
When all references are destroyed and the reference counter decrements to 0, the data on the heap will be freed.
An important fact to consider is that the data wrapped by the \mintinline{rust}{Rc} is immutable.
To make it mutable a trick such as using a \mintinline{rust}{RefCell} (see \ref{interior-mutability}) must be used.
It is possible to ``save'' a value from destruction, by using the method \mintinline{rust}{Rc::try_unwrap}.
It can be called when there is \textit{exactly one} reference to the object alive.
This can be seen in figure \ref{rc-unwrap}.
The method returns a \mintinline{rust}{Result} that must then be checked for the \mintinline{rust}{Ok}
variant.

There are also some downsides to the \mintinline{rust}{Rc} type.
\begin{itemize}
        \item Cyclic references can still not be freed.
        \item Computational cost during runtime, since \mintinline{rust}{Rc} cannot be evaluated at compile-time.
        \item \mintinline{rust}{Rc} is not thread-safe.
\end{itemize}
In multi-threaded scenarios it is wise to use \mintinline{rust}{Arc<T>}, which is basically an atomic version of the \mintinline{rust}{Rc} type.
This renders it thread-safe. 
\mintinline{rust}{Arc} functions in much the same way as \mintinline{rust}{Rc}, with the small caveat of being marginally slower in comparison to \mintinline{rust}{Rc}.

}        
\end{rustcode}

\subsection{Interior Mutability with Cell types}
\label{interior-mutability}
``\textit{Interior Mutability} is a design pattern in Rust for allowing you to mutate data even though there are immutable references to that data, which would normally be disallowed by the borrowing rules. The interior mutability pattern involves using unsafe code inside a data structure to bend Rust's usual rules around mutation and borrowing.''\cite{RustBook-InteriorMutability}.
There are two types that can be used for this pattern, \mintinline{rust}{Cell<T>} and \mintinline{rust}{RefCell<T>}.
These types are the owners of the type the encapsulate and they store it on the heap, similar to a \mintinline{rust}{Box<T>}.
The main difference between a \mintinline{rust}{Box} and one of the cell types is that borrowing rules are applied at compile-time for the \mintinline{rust}{Box}, but at runtime for the cell types.
These types can be used to ensure to the compiler that code that may look like it breaks the borrowing rules at compile-time, actually upholds the borrowing rules at runtime.
Should the code break the rules nevertheless, a \mintinline{rust}{panic} will be thrown at runtime.
The difference between the \mintinline{rust}{Cell<T>} and \mintinline{rust}{RefCell<T>} is that \mintinline{rust}{Cell<T>} is only usable for types that implement the \mintinline{rust}{Copy} trait, because of the way \mintinline{rust}{Cell<T>} handles interior mutability.
It mutates the data in the container by copying it outside, mutating it, and copying it back inside.
Obviously only \mintinline{rust}{Copy}-types can be used with this.
\mintinline{rust}{RefCell<T>} can be used with any type that implements the \mintinline{rust}{Sized} trait.
It uses references to mutate the data, without using the copy mechanism.
Figure \ref{mutability-refcell} shows how to construct both a \mintinline{rust}{Cell} and a \mintinline{rust}{RefCell} and how to borrow dynamically at runtime.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
fn main() {
    let i = 32;
    let cell = Cell:new(i);

    let refcell = RefCell::new(i);

    let r: &u32 = refcell.borrow();
    let mut r_mut: &mut u32
        = refcell.borrow_mut();
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Constructing a \mintinline{rust}{Cell} and a \mintinline{rust}{RefCell} object and borrowing dynamically.}
\label{mutability-refcell}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Raw pointers}
\label{raw-pointer}
Rust has two kinds of references that allow pointing to an arbitrary place in memory.
These references are called \textit{raw pointers}.
The two types are \mintinline{rust}{*const T} and \mintinline{rust}{*mut T}.
How to create such raw pointers is shown in figure \ref{raw-pointer-new} and in figure \ref{raw-pointer-new2}.
The difference between the \mintinline{rust}{const} and the \mintinline{rust}{mut} variants is simply whether the value in the underlying memory address can be mutated through the pointer, or not.
In the example in figure \ref{raw-pointer-new} we created two pointers to the same address.
One begin a \mintinline{rust}{const *u32} and the other a \mintinline{rust}{mut *u32}.
If we were to create a \mintinline{rust}{&u32} and a \mintinline{rust}{&mut u32} we would get a compiler error, but when working with raw pointers the usual borrowing rules don't apply.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
let count: u32 = 65;
let ptr = &count as *const u32;
let mut_ptr = &mut count as *mut u32;
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Creating two raw pointers from a reference to an \mintinline{rust}{u32}.}

\end{figure}

let address = 0x123456;
let ptr = address as *mut u32;
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Creating a raw pointer from an address.}
\label{raw-pointer-new2}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Writing unsafe Code}
\label{unsafe}
In some situations a programmer may need to write code, that the static guarantees of the compiler would reject.
Such situations may for example occur whenever raw pointers (see \ref{raw-pointer}) are used to work around some restriction of Rusts borrowing mechanism.
Another possibility is whenever Rust tries to interact with hardware directly, since hardware does not adhere to Rusts rules.
The \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} keyword can be used to communicate to the compiler, that the designated block contains 'unsafe' code.
'Unsafe' here means exactly the following behaviors:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Dereferencing a raw pointer.
        \item Calling an unsafe function or method.
        \item Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable.
        \item Implementing an unsafe trait.
        \item Accessing or modifying a field of a \mintinline{rust}{union} type.
\end{enumerate}
\cite{RustBook-Unsafe}.
\paragraph{Dereferencing a raw pointer} is considered unsafe, because raw pointers (see \ref{raw-pointer}) may point to arbitrary memory.
This mean a raw pointer could point to memory not even reserved by the program or to NULL.
When dereferencing such a pointer care must be taken to check whether the pointer is even valid first.
An example of this can be seen in figure \ref{unsafe-derefencing}.
Since the pointer here will be always be valid it is unnecessary to check it for validity.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
let count: u32 = 128;
let ptr = &count as *mut u32;
unsafe {
    *ptr = 130;
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Dereferencing a raw pointer and assigning a new value.}
\label{unsafe-derefencing}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Calling an unsafe function or method} is unsafe behavior, because these unsafe functions generally assume that some invariant is true before they are called.
A programmer may have unknowingly broken the invariant before calling the function, resulting in a memory violation or other unwanted behavior.
An example of this can be seen in figure \ref{unsafe-function}, in which the function \mintinline{text}{add_three} takes a mutable raw pointer (see \ref{raw-pointer}), offsets it by one, deferences it, and adds three to it.
Obviously this is not memory-safe when the pointer does not own the element after it in memory, and as such the function must be marked \mintinline{rust}{unsafe}.
The \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} keyword in the function definition additionally acts like an \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} block around the whole function body, which is the reason the dereferencing of the pointer in figure \ref{unsafe-function} is not wrapped in an \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} block.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
unsafe fn add_three(ptr: *mut u8) {
        *(ptr.offset(1)) += 3;
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{An unsafe function, that adds three to a pointer offset by one.}
\label{unsafe-function}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Accessing or updating a static mutable variable} is defined to be unsafe behavior.
Static mutable variables are comparable to global state in other programming languages.
Hoare describes Rust as having a ``safe concurrency model''\cite{HoareInterview}.
This is especially visible when looking at the concept of borrowing, where Rust enforces safe concurrency through the restrictions on \mintinline{rust}{&T} and \mintinline{rust}{&mut T} references.
Additionally it is Rusts responsibility to ensure data races on global state can not happen.
Thus the Rust compiler will not allow accessing or updating such global state, without declaring the operation
as \mintinline{rust}{unsafe}, after which it is the programmers responsibility to ensure correct handling of data races.
An example of updating a static mutable variable can be seen in figure \ref{unsafe-staticmut}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
static mut COUNT: u8 = 0;

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        COUNT = 1;
    }
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Updating a static mutable variable in an \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} block.}
\label{unsafe-staticmut}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Implementing an unsafe trait} is similar to an unsafe function.
Designating a block as \mintinline{rust}{unsafe} tells the compiler, that there is some invariant that he cannot check by himself, but that is crucial for program execution.
The structure of such an \mintinline{rust}{unsafe trait} can be seen in figure \ref{unsafe-trait}.
A common example of this is when implementing the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait for a type the compiler cannot automatically derive it for.
The documentation for the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait says ``This trait is automatically implemented when the compiler determines it's appropriate.''\cite{RustDoc-Send}.
Appropriate here means when all fields of the type implement the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait too.
Have a look at figure \ref{unsafe-send} in which he have a type \mintinline{rust}{Test} that has a raw pointer as a field.
Raw pointers do not implement the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait, since they have no guarantees about being used in shared environments.
This leads to our struct \mintinline{rust}{Test} not automatically having the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait.
We have to implement it manually with an \mintinline{rust}{unsafe impl}-block as shown.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
unsafe trait UnsafeTrait {}

unsafe impl UnsafeTrait for u8 {}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{The structure of an unsafe trait and its implementation.}
\label{unsafe-trait}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
struct Test {
    ptr: *mut u8, // Doesn't
                  // implement Send.
}

unsafe impl Send for Test {
// Somehow make the
// raw pointer thread-safe.
}
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Implementing the \mintinline{rust}{Send} trait for a struct with non-\mintinline{rust}{Send} fields.}
\label{unsafe-send}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Accessing or modifying a field of a \mintinline{rust}{union} type} is unsafe by definition.
Unions are similar to Enums, but do not store a tag to identify the variant used.
They were first introduced in stable Rust 1.19 (released on: 20-07-2017)\cite{RustRelease-Union}.
Without this tag the compiler does not know, which variant we want to use, and can not make sure we access it correctly.
\begin{figure}
\begin{rustcode}
union MyUnion {
    f1: u32,
    f2: u16,
}

let u = MyUnion{f2: 45};

unsafe {
    u.f2 = 3;
};

let v = unsafe {u.f2};
\end{rustcode}
\vspace{-2em}
\caption{Accessing and modifying a field of a \mintinline{rust}{union}.}

\section{Conclusion}
Rust is a valuable option over garbage-collected languages, when writing performance critical software.
Its strict rules lead to a steep learning curve, that may mean lowered efficiency for the programmer in the beginning.
It is especially suited for tasks that are currently in the domain of the C language, like server applications, operating systems programming and programming for embedded systems.
